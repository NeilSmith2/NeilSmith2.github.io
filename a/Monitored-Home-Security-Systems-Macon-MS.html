In this post, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

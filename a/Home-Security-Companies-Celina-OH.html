Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by.

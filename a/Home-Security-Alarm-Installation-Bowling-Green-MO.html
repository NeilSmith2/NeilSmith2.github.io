<p>Home security systems and modern smart home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to use their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone. Search for a design that uses a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety up to 25 feet, and cost effective cloud storage for tape-recorded video.

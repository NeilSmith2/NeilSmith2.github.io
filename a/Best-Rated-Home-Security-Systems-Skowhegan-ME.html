<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to cops capability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers support authorities reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a expensive and inefficient  technique to theft reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>

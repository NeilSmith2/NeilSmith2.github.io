<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security bundle, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community must carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent.

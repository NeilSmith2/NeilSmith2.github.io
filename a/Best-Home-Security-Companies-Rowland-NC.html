<p>There's a lot that goes into a normal CCTV video surveillance system.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>

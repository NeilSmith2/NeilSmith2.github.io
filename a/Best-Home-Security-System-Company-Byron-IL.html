When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

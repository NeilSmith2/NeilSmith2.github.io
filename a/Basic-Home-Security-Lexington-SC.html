<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 companies, universities, and federal government centers, and residential clients. After researching 4 different security systems, we decided on SSA. They offered us the very best description of their services and used us more for the cash.

<p>Your security and personal privacy are made sure. Our consultants can not see anything that is on your computer. They just have the ability to "serve" a page from our website and put products in your cart. You remain in control at all times, and you can detach at any time by closing your web browser window. You'll also pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, specifically for cameras. And to be sincere, we're not awfully impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first place. What you're paying for is mainly that big name in blue.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

<p>Best Expert Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide easy Do It Yourself installation, other companies use (and often need) expert installation. Professional installation is readily available for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Remember that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>

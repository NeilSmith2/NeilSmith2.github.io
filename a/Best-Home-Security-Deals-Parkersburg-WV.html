Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi details. (You must play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets groan, felines shriek, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>

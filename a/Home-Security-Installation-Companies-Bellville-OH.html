<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment in this manner to make consumers stick with them longer, since changing monitoring companies suggests numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
<p>Everyone we handled at NSS were really useful and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we wanted, and they performed with professionalism and skills.

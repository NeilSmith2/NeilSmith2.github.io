<p>Given that the glass real estate does not get in the way, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they make up for it in abilities. As well as being fantastic for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for infrared and low-light because the glass real estate does not impede the lens. With some, it's hard to tell at a glance where they've been aimed, so they can provide a panoptic impression as a deterrent, regardless of their real field of view.

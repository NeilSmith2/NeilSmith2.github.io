<p>Alarm monitoring belongs to a complete home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (typically very high decibel so that you can hear it as can neighbors in many cases) and sounds an alarm with an expert monitoring company.

Windows smash, pet dogs groan, cats shriek, infants cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>

The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

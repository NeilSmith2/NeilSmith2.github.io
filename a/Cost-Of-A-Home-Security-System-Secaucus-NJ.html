I've had their doorbell for a year - never ever a problem. And their cameras are better priced than any others. With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

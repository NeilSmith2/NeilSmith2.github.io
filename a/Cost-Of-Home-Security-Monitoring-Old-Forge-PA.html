The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

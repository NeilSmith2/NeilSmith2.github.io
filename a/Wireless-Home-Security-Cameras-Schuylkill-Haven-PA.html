Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

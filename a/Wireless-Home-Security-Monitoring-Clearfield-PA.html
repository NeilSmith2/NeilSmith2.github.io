<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". Wireless is the method of the future. Some leading home security companies use professional installation, while others preconfigure your system at the factory and ship to your door for simply Do It Yourself setup. See the best wireless options listed below. Frontpoint Security provides a simple and wise  monitored home security service, utilizing a wide variety of different wireless gadgets.

<p>Essentially, a wireless security system is comprised of alarms, sensors, cameras, and various detectors all linked to a primary control board by means of radio signals. For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hours a day using IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would require 2.79 terabytes of storage area for footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder before purchasing.</p>

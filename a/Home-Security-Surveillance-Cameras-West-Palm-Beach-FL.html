<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder before purchasing.</p>

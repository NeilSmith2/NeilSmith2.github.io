In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, normally via 110VAC power.</p>

If somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the alarm system.

<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>

Homeowners can choose from outdoor or indoor security cameras that can record video when an alarm is set off, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, nanny cameras, and more. All of these cameras can be incorporated into the overall system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic understanding of alarm systems is practical.

IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor options due to the fact that their design permits minimum glare.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.

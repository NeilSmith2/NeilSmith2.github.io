It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage.

There's no latency so you get informed instantly so you can take immediate actions such as setting off a loud alarm, getting in touch with the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to talk to the possible burglars.</p>

This ensures a quick reaction and reduces the burglar's chances of success.</p>

ADT uses an independent distributor model including third-party dealers. The dealers identify which equipment to utilize. Expenses for systems differ.

<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, catering to advanced wise home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I tested, including smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

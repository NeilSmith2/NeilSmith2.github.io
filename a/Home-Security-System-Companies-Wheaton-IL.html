With a wireless system, you can also get push notices on your phone or tablet that let you know there is a concern, even when you're not in the house.</p>
<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense avoidance created to avoid both individual and residential or commercial property criminal offense and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a particular location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011).

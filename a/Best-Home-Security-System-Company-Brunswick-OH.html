<p>The first (and most apparent, for sure) component of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are ideal for your system depends on your specific requirements and budget plan; are you putting them indoors or outdoors? Is 1080P a big enough resolution?

A wireless bridge is a great choice for long range circumstances where trees and poles are not present.</p>

<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, theft, and scams. Suggestion: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We should once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of expensive false alarms.

Wide-angle lenses decrease the number of cameras required to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might reveal a 360-degree view, however the best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or much better.

Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually through 110VAC power.</p>

The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, along with when we made changes in the settings.</p>

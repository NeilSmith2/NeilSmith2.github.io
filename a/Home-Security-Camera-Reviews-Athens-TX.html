<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, theft, and scams. Suggestion: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We should once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of expensive false alarms.

Wide-angle lenses decrease the number of cameras required to monitor your home.

When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually through 110VAC power.</p>

The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, along with when we made changes in the settings.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider area and for that reason uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

Considering that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop notifications (and recording, considering that it does that even when notifications are off).

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

The company's Nest Thermostat E, Nest Knowing Thermostat, Element Thermostat, and Philips Color can be contributed to any security package.

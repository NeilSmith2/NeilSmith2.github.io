The $260 Essentials package consists of the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensing units, one motion sensor, a backyard sign, and two window decals. For $15 each month, you can add around-the-clock expert monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive strategy includes control through iOS and Android smart device apps, push and e-mail informs, and 30-day event-footage storage for endless cameras, consisting of the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is offered individually.

SimpliSafe produces and offers its own devices. The quality of this equipment seems satisfactory to many users, though it can't be utilized with a different monitoring service like third-party equipment might. ADT is one of the more expensive home security companies, with pricey video monitoring and steep early termination fees.

When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, scams, and theft. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should again respond to the alarm; each action is billed.

(For a take a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for The Majority Of People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good general rule that if your smartphone or laptop gets good Wi-Fi reception in the area you want to mount the camera, you likely will not have a problem.</p>

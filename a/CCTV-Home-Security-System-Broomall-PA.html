<p>While every property owner stresses over burglaries, apprehension has actually surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complicated agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently resulting in incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a totally free mobile phone app that allows people who see something suspicious to take an image and quickly send it to public safety officials.

<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, fraud, and vandalism. Idea: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again react to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating pricey incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it instantly shut off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can immediately make the wise lights turn on to frighten prospective burglars.</p>

They are relatively easy to install, but if you're not familiar or comfy with electrical circuitry, you may want to have an expert electrician do the job.</p>
<p>Geofencing: This feature automates motion detection when you return or leave to a predetermined location (typically your home). In this manner, you do not need to remember to turn off the camera's monitoring functions every time you get home. For this to work properly, every user in the home (consisting of kids) would require the app set up and geofencing allowed on their phones. We also preferred models that let you disable the automated Away option.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you stroll by.

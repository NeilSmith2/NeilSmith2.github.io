<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>

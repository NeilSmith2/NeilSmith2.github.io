<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business interactions were primarily simultaneous. To accomplish nearly anything, someone live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, especially when dealing with international and national business. The very same is true for security and video surveillance. Normally, CCTV is most efficient as an active system, with a security personnel monitoring the corridors and someone else, someplace, seeing video surveillance displays for support. Whatever is integrated and everything occurs in real time.</p>
<p>Another essential subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend just how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about four times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>

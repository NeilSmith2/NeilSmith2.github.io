<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

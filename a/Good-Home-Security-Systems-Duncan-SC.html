We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top areas. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With basic smart home gadgets like automated door locks, you can stay in bed and examine that you locked your doors.

<p>Alarm monitoring belongs to a complete home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (often very high decibel so that you can hear it as can next-door neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company. The control board communicates with the other parts of the system, including the cameras, doors and window sensing units, and motion sensors, to detect an intruder or something that is wrong. Then, the monitoring company right away sets to action, getting in touch with you and alerting the authorities.</p>

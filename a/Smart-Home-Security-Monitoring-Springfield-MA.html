<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police ability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support authorities action to alarmed homes) a inefficient and expensive technique to theft reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>

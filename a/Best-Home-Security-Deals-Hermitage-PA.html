As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

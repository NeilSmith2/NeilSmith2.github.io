<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, because it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a fantastic security camera and an extraordinary worth.

The camera includes a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription prepare for additional cloud storage.

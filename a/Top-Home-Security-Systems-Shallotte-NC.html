<p>While every homeowner stresses over break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complicated agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces frequently leading to incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a complimentary mobile phone app that permits residents who see something suspicious to take a picture and quickly send it to public safety authorities.

If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable (take a look at the cord behind the TV that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that implies you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. You can update your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax infrastructure if you buy HD-CCTV security system.

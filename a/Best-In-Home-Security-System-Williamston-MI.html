Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video footage to the cloud. The broad face of the camera gives you an excellent visual field, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.)

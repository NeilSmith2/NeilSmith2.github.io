<p>Unlike standard burglar alarms, which have a control panel (typically situated in the entrance hall) that is utilized to deactivate the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensors have been set off, smart alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have actually been activated, rather than getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially irritating your neighbours).

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually through 110VAC power.</p>

<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction.

<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal worth. It gets an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is simpler to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership prepare for additional cloud storage.

Luckily, surveillance doesn't need to be tough. Keep checking out to see the equipment and elements you'll need to get your IP surveillance system up and running.</p>

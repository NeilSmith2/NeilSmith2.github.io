<p>Thanks to current developments in technology, wireless security systems are now as efficient as wired systems If you've decided to install a burglar alarm, you need to consider the following benefits of wireless innovation. The $260 Fundamentals package includes the base station, a keypad, four entry sensors, one motion sensing unit, a backyard indication, and two window decals. For $15 each month, you can add 24/7 professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can interact with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive plan adds control by means of iOS and Android smart device apps, push and email informs, and 30-day event-footage storage for unlimited cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is readily available individually.

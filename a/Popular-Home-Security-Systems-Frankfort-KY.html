A few models use batteries, making placement more versatile, but this requires other compromises, which we highlight in the Competition area. Wi-Fi coverage also affects where you place a camera: If you wish to put a camera in a spot that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, think about upgrading your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a take a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for Most People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good general rule that if your smartphone or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to install the camera, you likely will not have a problem.</p>

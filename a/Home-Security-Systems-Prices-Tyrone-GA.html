<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and once again in customer reviews, and it delivers a crisp photo up to 32 feet.

<h3>Business Alarm Systems Tyrone GA 30290</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, need to supply at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more available for a regular monthly cost ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it may leave you with tape-recording gaps throughout crucial security events.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides free perks like individual detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 per month.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face notifies worked only about half of the time and the camera routinely detached from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, in addition to when we made modifications in the settings.</p>
<h3>Best Home Security Camera in Georgia</h3>
<p>Because it's more complex than it must be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a should for usage when you're away from home, but you shouldn't need to fumble with your phone when you're coming and going.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>You can choose from SimpliSafe's original acclaimed system or their newest line of equipment. Both systems provide impressive, reputable home security. With the more recent system, you will pay more, but that higher price includes a system that is smaller, faster, and more powerful.

Select billing period: Regular monthly or Yearly. We get a 15% prepay discount rate from our UL main station provider which we hand down to our annual consumers.

<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>

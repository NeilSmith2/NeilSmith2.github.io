<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be convenient for installation. Due to the fact that it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look just like these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Kid was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is really fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>

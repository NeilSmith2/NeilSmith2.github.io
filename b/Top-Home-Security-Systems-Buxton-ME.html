The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the deck by a licensed electrician (who takes place to be my other half). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>

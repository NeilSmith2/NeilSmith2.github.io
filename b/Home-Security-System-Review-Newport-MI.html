<p>The very best in smart home security systems. . According to an FBI report, 58.3 percent of break-ins in the United States involved forcible entry. Per the most current data, the average burglary in the United States lasts for about 90 seconds to 12 minutes and, on average, a burglar will get into a home within 60 seconds. 1 2 The majority of thefts target money first followed by gems, electronics, and drugs. 3 Common security methods include never hiding additional secrets outside, never ever switching off all the lights, using small CCTV stickers on doors, and keeping good tabs with neighbours.</p>

When the change in field strength compromises due to the presence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is created. The system is covert after installation.

Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will lower criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other nearby locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

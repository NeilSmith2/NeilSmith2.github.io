<p>So, while alarm may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community must take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent.

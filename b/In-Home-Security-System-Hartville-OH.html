<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>

<h2>Managed Digital Video Surveillance Clarkston</h2>
<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they take place frequently enough. Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>

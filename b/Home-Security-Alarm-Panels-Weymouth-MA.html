I'm not exactly sure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera performs all that well when it's foggy or raining, especially during the night when weather really mess with the night vision.

The Angee is low on features and big on operating expenses. The Ooma Butterfleye has no night vision and has bad daytime video; the Reolink C1 Pro frequently showed green and pink lines throughout the screen; the Yi Dome Camera continuously flickered during the night; and the Samsung SmartCam had bad audio and a confusing app.</p>

<p>B. The owner will make sure all alarm system systems are preserved per producer requirements and embraced codes. The camera's viewing angle determines just how much space the camera will cover. Wide-angle lenses reduce the variety of cameras needed to monitor your home.

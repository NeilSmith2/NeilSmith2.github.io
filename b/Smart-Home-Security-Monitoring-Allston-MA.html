<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, theft, and fraud. Tip: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should once again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of costly false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically turn off the heating unit.

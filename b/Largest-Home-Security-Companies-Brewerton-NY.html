We've found great deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll discover more than 30 brand names offered. In some cases you do not have an option. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT use just professional installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a DIY option. ADT does not have the greatest customer care credibility amongst the companies we thought about, racking up more than 3,000 problems on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked most of this as much as the fact that ADT has several million more clients than its competitors, our tester started his call with low expectations.</p>

They aren't weatherproof, and you may desire outdoor or indoor cameras with more advanced functions. You can find out more with our full SimpliSafe review.</p>

<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped casing that the camera sits in. Whilst these are relatively discreet CCTV cameras in look, this doesn't stop them from hindering bad guys. This is due to the fact that the dome case makes it actually tough for individuals to see which direction the camera is pointing. This creates an air of unpredictability for prospective thieves or vandals approaching from all directions. If those scenarios sound like your life, Vivint and Link Interactive use some flexibility on monitoring contract length if you buy equipment in advance.

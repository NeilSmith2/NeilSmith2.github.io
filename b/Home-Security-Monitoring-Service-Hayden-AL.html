Whether you own or lease, you desire the very best security camera system for keeping an eye on your home while you're gone. That used to entail finalizing on with a professional-- and expensive-- security service like ADT.

At Valley Alarm, we don't sell equipment packages" that offer only the illusion of security.

<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most challenging setup understood to male. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi information. (You need to play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets growl, cats squeal, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly cutting-edge, so we're actually advising the security cameras here.

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All items produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy produced by a things is called its heat signature. In general, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of finding small distinctions in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based on information about the temperature differences.

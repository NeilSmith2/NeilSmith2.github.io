<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction.

Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

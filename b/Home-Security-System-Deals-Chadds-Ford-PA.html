<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

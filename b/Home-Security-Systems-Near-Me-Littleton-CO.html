<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>

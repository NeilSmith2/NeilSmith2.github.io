Methods included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and getting in touch with leading researchers to inquire about upcoming assessments. Both released and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was worldwide in scope.</p>

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>

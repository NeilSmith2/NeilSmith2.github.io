<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the same way as public cameras? We also need to draw fine lines about 'Who really is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge bro? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody!

<h3>Motion Activated Security Camera in Winona MN</h3>
<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control board (generally located in the entrance hall) that is utilized to disarm the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensing units have actually been triggered, clever alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and alerts you if any of the sensors have actually been triggered, rather than getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly frustrating your neighbours).

From security signals to optional live surveillance video and far more, FederalConnect uses added convenience and comfort. Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the restricted series of sensors. Most radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet. This indicates that you need to structure your wireless system with this in mind, specifically if your residential or commercial property is larger than 4,500 square feet.</p>

It's also more tamper-proof than any of our other picks, however that added security makes for a more difficult installation process, and it costs nearly two times the cost of the Nest Web Cam Outdoor.</p>

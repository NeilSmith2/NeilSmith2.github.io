<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the exact same way as public cameras? We also require to draw fine lines about 'Who really is enjoying you'?

If an individual was standing enjoying outside a window it might be a criminal activity, yet the very same person might put a surveillance camera then remotely view an individual within the personal privacy of their home.

<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which implies. If somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system.

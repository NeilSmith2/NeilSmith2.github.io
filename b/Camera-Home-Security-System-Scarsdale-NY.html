<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, catering to advanced clever home aficionados or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I evaluated, including creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.

<p>Hybrid systems use both wired and wireless sensing units to attain the advantages of both. Transmitters can also be linked through the premises' electrical circuits to transfer coded signals to the control unit (line provider). The control system generally has a separate channel or zone for burglar and fire sensors, and much better systems have a separate zone for each different sensing unit, in addition to internal trouble signs (mains power loss, low battery, damaged wire, etc.).</p>

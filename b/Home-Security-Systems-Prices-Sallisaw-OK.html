When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, clever lock, and so on), I want to make certain that they all easily communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>

However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

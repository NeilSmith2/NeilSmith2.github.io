When it spotted any type of interference, SimpliSafe responded with a statement stating the system would inform users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the issue.

This permits you to have a record of events and can assist aid law enforcement in the event of a burglary or vandalism. A closed-circuit is the most common, and when an electrical current is constantly running around the perimeter of the home, breaking the circuit - by opening a door or window - cuts off the electric current.

Rather, you can filter occasion notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you stroll by.

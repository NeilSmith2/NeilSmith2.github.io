<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. With years of experience installing and monitoring video and audio security systems for Seattle companies and homes, we've built fantastic relationships with both local police and their clients. Likewise, do not forget that your wireless network security can be in some cases weak, and vulnerable to exploits. It almost doesn't matter how strong your password is or if your software is up to date if cybercriminals can simply hijack your Wi-Fi information.

<p>The very first (and most apparent, for sure) component of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are best for your system depends on your specific needs and budget; are you putting them indoors or outdoors? Is 1080P a big adequate resolution? Will they have the ability to tape and see video effectively in low-lighting? Are they positioned with adequate field of view, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be required?

<p>Canary has got over some initial software problems to provide an extremely decent security camera choice: especially that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of vision, night vision and motion informs (plus clear audio). What's more, that 90+ decibel siren makes it more of a severe security camera than some others here (though it needs to be manually activated when you find something awry).

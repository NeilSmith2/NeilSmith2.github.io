<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. However, Nest Secure does have its drawbacks: lots of BBB reviewers have concerns with poor tech support and a lack of details on warranties.

Wired security systems are linked by hard-wired cable televisions and require access to power outlets, making them more difficult to location and install. Wireless systems, on the other hand, use a WiFi connection, fast to establish, and can be put anywhere inside (or outside) your home.</p>

However, remember that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

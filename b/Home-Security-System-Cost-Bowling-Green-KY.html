As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

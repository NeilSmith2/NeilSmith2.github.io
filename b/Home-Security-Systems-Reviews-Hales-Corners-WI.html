<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you require extra cable televisions.

With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>

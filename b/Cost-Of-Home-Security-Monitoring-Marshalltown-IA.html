<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational crime avoidance created to avoid both individual and property criminal activity and can be utilized in location of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit images of a particular location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011).

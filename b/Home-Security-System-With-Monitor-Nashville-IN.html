<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

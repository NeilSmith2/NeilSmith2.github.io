<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering several decades.

Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and often over long distances.

This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, normally via 110VAC power.</p>

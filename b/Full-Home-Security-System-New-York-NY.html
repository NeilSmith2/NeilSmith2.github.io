<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

<p>Discover how to design, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and decrease criminal activity. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with terrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our system was defective, therefore we might review this evaluation. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video to the cloud.

For example, Scout just provides one security camera (and it's for indoor usage only).

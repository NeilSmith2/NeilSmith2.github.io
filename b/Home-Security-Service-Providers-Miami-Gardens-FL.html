<p>Discover how to design, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and lower crime. The Ring Floodlight Camera integrates two important devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera identifies movement, it turns on its 2 effective LED beams in addition to its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording.

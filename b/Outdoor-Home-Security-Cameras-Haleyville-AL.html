<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and fraud. Idea: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again respond to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of removing expensive incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it instantly turn off the heater. If the motion sensors are activated, you can automatically make the clever lights turn on to scare away possible robbers.</p>
<p>You're in the eye of the public when you're in a public area. So what's the difference in being enjoyed by a closed circuit TELEVISION camera? Even if you were captured picking your nose the cops aren't going to apprehend you for that and no surveillance officer is going to put it on nationwide tv.

If there are three choose fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single set camera can just see one.

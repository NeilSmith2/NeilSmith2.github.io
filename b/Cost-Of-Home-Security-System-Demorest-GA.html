<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries.

Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more circuitry.

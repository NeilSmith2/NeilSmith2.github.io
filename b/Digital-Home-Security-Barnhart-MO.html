<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the obligation of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to store and the length of time you prepare to keep taped footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage once you reach the system's capability, however if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>

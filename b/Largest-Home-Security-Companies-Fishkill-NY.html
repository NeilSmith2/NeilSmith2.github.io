The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our testing. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And despite having an appealing rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>

When Spotlight Cam discovers motion, it starts streaming video, shines its lights and sends notices to your tablet, pc and phone.

<p>Flood sensors don't prevent water from entering your home, they simply inform you as quickly as wetness is found. The prompt alert provides you time to remedy the situation before any significant damage occurs. All three of our top picks for Seattle offer battery-powered flood or water sensing units. They link to the company's respective app, so you're always in the know. Frontpoint's flood sensing units cost just $44.99 and use three to five times more variety than ADT's and Vivint's.

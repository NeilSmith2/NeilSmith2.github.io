<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage option and others don't. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage usually include either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage choice saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself. This alternative is usually cost-free. A cloud storage alternative conserves your video in the cloud.

<p>3 big advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their portability, expandability and impermanence. Occupants, unlike property owners, generally avoid making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other components can quickly be established at different residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too. Wireless security strategies also allow remote control of the system and general home automation.

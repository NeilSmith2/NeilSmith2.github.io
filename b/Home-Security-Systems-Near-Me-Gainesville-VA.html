If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to eat up storage area rapidly.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR.

<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.

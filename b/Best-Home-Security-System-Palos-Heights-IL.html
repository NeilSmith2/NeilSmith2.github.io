<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the specific same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>

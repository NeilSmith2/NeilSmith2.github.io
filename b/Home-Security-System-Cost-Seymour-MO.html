<p>so say you have a camera that somebody can see it they would shoot it if they had a gun so I recommend to have cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras.

<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we evaluated, and it uses two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control belongs to the natural merging of security technologies.

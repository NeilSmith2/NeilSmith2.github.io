<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we evaluated, and it uses two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.

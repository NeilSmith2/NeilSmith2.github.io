<p>Ring might not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), however it sure has actually acquired rather the fanfare for many years. We've been checking Ring Alarm quite a bit lately, and we really like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security package that provides basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you pick the free self-monitor" alternative.</p>
<p>Canary has overcome some preliminary software application issues to use a really good security camera option: especially that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of view, night vision and motion informs (plus clear audio).

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>

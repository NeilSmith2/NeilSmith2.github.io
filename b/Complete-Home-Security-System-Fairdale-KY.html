Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared essential WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>

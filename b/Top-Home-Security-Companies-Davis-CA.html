Even better-- if you get sick of self-monitoring or will not be in cell service for a while, you can do a month of no-contract expert monitoring with Residence.</p>
<p>While the prices for both packages are affordable provided what they provide, many clients have actually left dissatisfactory reviews on Yelp and somewhere else, suffering poor customer care and misleading marketing strategies. So, be encouraged in reading the fine print on the contract prior to finalizing. Nevertheless, the 30-day risk free offer and 2-year warranty must ease concerns, somewhat.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly groundbreaking, so we're actually suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative.

So choose what will be the better offer for you. Go with the agreement and enjoy those savings if you know you'll stay put for at least three years. But if you might upgrade to a new office with various security requirements, contract-free is your best bet.</p>

<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment in this manner to make clients stick with them longer, since changing monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for consumers. How did they do it? They placed 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>

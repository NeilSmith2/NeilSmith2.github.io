<p>The NVR removes these problems, because it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder before purchasing.</p>

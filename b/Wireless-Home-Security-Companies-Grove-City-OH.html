<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to solve detail after the fact, which suggests that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it likewise brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage space. So much, in fact, that they require about 4 times the hard drive space of 1080p to tape the same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more cash if extended video storage is necessary.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>

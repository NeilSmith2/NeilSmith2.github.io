<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras reduce criminal activity. HD CCTV systems work with standard analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable (take a look at the cord behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that implies you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can update your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax infrastructure.

<p>While not an important requirement for a home security system, all top companies offer a range of camera choices as add-ons. Property owners can pick from outdoor or indoor security cameras that can record video footage when an alarm is set off, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, baby-sitter cameras, and more. All of these cameras can be incorporated into the overall system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic understanding of alarm systems is valuable. Although there are a variety of extra system components offered including smoke alarm and wireless security cameras, the basic alarm system consists of three primary components: a keypad control board, specific sensors, and a manned monitoring station.</p>

When the change in field strength damages due to the presence of a things and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is generated. The system is concealed after installation.

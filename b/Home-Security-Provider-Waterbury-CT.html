False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they take place regularly enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically balanced out by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
<p>One example of SimpliSafe's high quality is their SmashSafe backup against tampering: If someone attempts to disable your system, the monitoring service will inform cops.

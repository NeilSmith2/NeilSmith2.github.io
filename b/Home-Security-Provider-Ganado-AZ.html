<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a great security camera and an extraordinary value. It receives an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership prepare for extra cloud storage. But the company does offer a Total Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is discovered. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>Worth keeping in mind: you can also get an outdoor variation (₤ 199.99, Amazon) which is basically the exact same however with a variety included features. This one has a motion-sensor and changes on a light and siren which may be a good deterrent to trespassers, plus it's clearly water resistant and has a longer cable. Otherwise, very same idea, same app, still simply as simple. to setup. And you do not require to stress over its battery life. Normally, the battery might last for 4 to 6 months per charge.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>

<p>No. Monitored medical alarms are not included in this new law. These alarms vary from panic alarms, which are covered. Panic alarms get authorities action based on fear of impending injury or bodily damage due to criminal activity, while medical alarms usually receive fire response based upon an emergency due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.

Its double articulating LED floodlights cover a really broad area, and you can dim them by means of its app if you want mood lighting on your deck or patio area for a party.

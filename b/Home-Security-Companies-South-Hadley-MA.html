<p>TP-Link's Kasa Cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that might equal some of our top choices. It likewise comes with 2 days of free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can pack in clips of up to 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control panel and keypads, different sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are understood to be especially practical in this stage.</p>

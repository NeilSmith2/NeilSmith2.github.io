<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the duty of the whole community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to store and for how long you plan to keep taped footage. The video footage is going to consume up storage area quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution.

<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, because it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

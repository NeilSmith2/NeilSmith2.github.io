<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search innovation that is rapidly changing the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so crucial?  For starters, Deep Knowing permits someone to find what they are searching for without needing to search through hours of useless video footage.  Picture a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the aspects you are trying to find in the recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we just type police" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police car appears.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>

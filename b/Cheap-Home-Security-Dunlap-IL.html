The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>

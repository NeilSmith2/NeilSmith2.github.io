<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation.

When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

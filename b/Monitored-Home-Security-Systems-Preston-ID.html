<p>Many modern CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to enjoy a few of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs convert the analog video footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capacity, makes it much easier to browse archived video footage, and also permits users to stream video over a network for remote watching from several places. Often, the mere existence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated trespassers. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or harmed by the more identified burglars. They may likewise be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks if trespassers can not see any security cameras.</p>

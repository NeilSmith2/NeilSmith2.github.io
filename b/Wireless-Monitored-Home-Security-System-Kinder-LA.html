With security camera control in the palm of your hand, peace of mind is yours.</p>
<p>Basically, a wireless security system is consisted of alarms, sensors, cameras, and different detectors all linked to a main control panel by means of radio signals. For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hours a day utilizing IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would require 2.79 terabytes of storage space for video footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

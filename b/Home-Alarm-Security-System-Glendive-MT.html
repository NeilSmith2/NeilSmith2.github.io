<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to store and the length of time you prepare to keep recorded video. The footage is going to consume up storage area rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution.

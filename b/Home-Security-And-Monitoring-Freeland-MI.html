<p>As explained by Cornish and Clarke (2003 ), CCTV is a form of official surveillance," implying that not only does CCTV have the ability to take the place of authorities or security officers however CCTV can also boost officers' capabilities (Welsh and Farrington 2008). In addition to functioning as a deterrent, cameras can alert authorities of criminal activities as they occur, which can allow officers to respond rapidly and efficiently (La Vigne et al. 2011). On a bigger scale, the use of CCTV also presents the possibility of aiding in the criminal justice system, as video footage of a criminal activity might help in prosecutions and investigations (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a statement stating the system would alert users when it identified any kind of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would require to be an ideal storm of circumstances for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the problem. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, our company believe this problem is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe clients who own the current system.</p>

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective offenders are less most likely to dedicate crime if they think they are being viewed or have a greater danger of being nabbed. This is also called the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense prevention method, which argues that chances to offend can be reduced by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and lowering provocations that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).

The app is extremely excellent, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, developing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or showing up the heat when you journey the motion sensor in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>We also love that Ring still has decent clever home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, don't work so well with smart home gadgets like lights and locks. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your wise outlets with your general security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is fairly easy.

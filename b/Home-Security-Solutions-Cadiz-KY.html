Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will reduce criminal offense and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other close-by locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

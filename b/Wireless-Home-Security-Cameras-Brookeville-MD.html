For that reason, each homeowner has to consider their own threat tolerance, however it's generally worth investing in a real home security system that uses solid comfort.</p>

<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it ought to be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

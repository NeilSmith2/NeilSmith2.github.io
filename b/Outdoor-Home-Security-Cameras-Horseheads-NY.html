<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom.

<h3>Best Wireless Home Security System in New York</h3>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>

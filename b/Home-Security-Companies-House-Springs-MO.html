<p>When it concerns technology, dependability is an extremely subjective matter, depending on which features and benefits an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and agile, but low signal strength and poor connectivity are still typical problems. Hardwired systems need minimal maintenance, and short of a general power outage, are harder to interrupt. In spite of a basic improvement in wireless innovation, there appear to be fewer methods for hardwired systems to be disrupted and disarmed.</p>
<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their portability, expandability and impermanence.

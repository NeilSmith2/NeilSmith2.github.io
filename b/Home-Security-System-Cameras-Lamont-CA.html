<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats since this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest offender for brief battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit limited to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>For clever home functions, we suggest the ADT Pulse bundle. It provides complete IFTTT (If This Then That) technology to let you from another location arm and deactivate your system, turn lights and other electronic devices on and off, and control the thermostat so you never need to come home to a chilly house.

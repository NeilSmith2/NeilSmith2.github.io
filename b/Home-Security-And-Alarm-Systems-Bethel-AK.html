The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to fix information after the fact, which means that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it likewise brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are huge and use up a lot of recording storage area. A lot, in reality, that they need about four times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape the very same length of video footage.

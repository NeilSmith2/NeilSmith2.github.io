Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to store and for how long you prepare to keep recorded video. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to eat up storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video when you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
